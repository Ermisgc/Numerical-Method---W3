作业的题目如下，供学习交流只用：
1. The accompanying table gives the hourly temperature readings (Fahrenheit) during a 12-hour period in a suburb of Los Angeles. Find the natural cubic spline for the data. Graph the natural cubic spline and the data on the same coordinate system. Use the natural cubic spline and the results of part(a) of Exercise 12 to approximate the average temperature during the 12-hour period.
